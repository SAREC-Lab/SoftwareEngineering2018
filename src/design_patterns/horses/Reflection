                                        Horse Race
                                        
          I used a Race class sort of as a base/main class in my project. This included a 
enrollHorse method which allowed me to enroll 5 horses in the race and choose their strategy. 
This was done with a array of the Horse objects. Then in a startRace method, the respective runs 
and displays were running until one of them was finished in which cased it outputted the winner. 
So, in the Horse class, all the universal variables for the horse were initialized, things 
like position, name, speed etc. these would later be altered in their own strategy classes. 
All the strategy classes were created as extensions from the Horse class. This was done so 
they could alter and use the variables associated with the horse such as speed. In each strategy 
the horses speed is updated when it should be, and the horse’s position is incremented based off 
the updated speed, this is done until the horse passes 10 miles. I tinkered with what the type 
of the strategies for hours figuring out ways to make them able to alter the horse’s values but 
still be changeable outside the constructor, and this was the best solution I could come up with.
