To approach the design process, I tried to figure out how all the different classes related to eachother.
The first question I was able to address by tweaking the code that was already present. Adding the second
train and track was easier given the fact that those were done in simulation. The cars were already
set up to work within the gates present, so I was able to link the gate to the second train by adding it 
to the observer present.  Initally it would respond incorrectly to a new train coming in, so I created 
some logic that checked with both trains before opening the gate to let cars through.Ideally I think 
creating a method to automate this process would be ideal going foward, however it was addressed with 
incrimental design. 

Moving to the second task, I origionally tried to approach it in the same way. When that didn't work, I
believe since the roads/car factories are independent. I tried to create an intersection class, that I could
then assign to the spot that the cars traveling east -> west would have to interact with. I wasn't able to
intergrate this into the design. I wanted to affect car.move(), which was called in car factory, but wasn't
able to pass the cars on the road into that. To address the movement, however, I was able to get the cars to
move over to the other side, using the logic in car move based on what side of the track that was on. These
changes, didn't impact the overall design, and were built into the classes present. I was hoping to use the 
intersection class to build on that functionality, and set it up on both sides you could easily send cars both
ways and I think would be the major goal going foward.
