The intersection class, if continued to build up would be helpful. as well as the logic behind syncing the gate. This would
allow for things like a different sized train, or more gates to be added and the cars will still not cross wrongly. What would
not scale well would be the turing logic. Since it is based on car location you would need to go in a map all the intersections
based on cordinates instead of being able to drag and drop an intersection if one was added or not mapped in the first place.
