After the UML, I have done initial map design and the set up of the observer class Chip.  I wanted to get the layout functioning before moving forward with the images and have begun to design the two levels which will be a more time consuming process. I hope to have aliens that chase chip, as well as a concept of lock and key that will force chip to explore the map before advancing between the levels.
