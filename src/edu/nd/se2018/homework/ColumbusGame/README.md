<b>Reflection</b>

I liked the design implemented because it did a very good job of encapsulating each class' functionality. I played around with designing the pirate ship differently than the player ship to test it out. I had the image and image view being a part of the pirate class, instead of being outside like the normal player ship. I found this be an even better encapsulation of functionality.
