Reflection

The biggest design decision there was to make was how to represent the different race strategies. I've used Java quite a bit before and have always liked using global static variables to set the "mode" or "type" of a class that has multiple functionalities, so I chose to do that. This is more memory efficient when compared to creating an abstract class that is inherited by other classes that implement a given method, or an interface. I also chose to initialize the Horses array in the main method so that the class RaceSimulator would not have to know anything about the RaceStrategy class. This way, if I wanted to change the design such that RaceStrategy was an abstract class and create other classes to inherit from it, I would not have to change any code in RaceSimulator or in Horse. It's a robust and flexible design, that is easy to understand.
