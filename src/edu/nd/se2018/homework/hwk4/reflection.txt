Reflecting on the design used, I could see that as I became more comfortable with the javafx library I was more easily able to structure the builing, escpecially of images, with the end result of the program in mind.  I would have liked to have more time to play around with what I called the "oceanGrid" this was what I used to store the infomration about the location of opbjects in the game. This was a really important data structure and I found myself having to add some workarounds to get it passed between classes. There is likely a better way to make the structure more fluid.  It would also be good to have more live edits to oceanGrid. The islands were static, but I would have liked to design a game winning sequence, and maybe a high score for number of moves before the pirates catch you.

With regards to the entend, I think reseting the game, given my build, would have been a GUI challange and not a variable one.  My islands are all allocated randomly and dynamically as the background is being built. Then they are just marked in the oceanGrid, going back to my earlier point. Also, going more testing with the movement scale to make it more compeititive.
